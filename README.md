Machine Learning
# Types of Systems of Machine Learning
Supervised
Unsupervised
Semi-supervised
Reinforcement Learning
# Supervised Learning
Labeled Data

# Unsupervised Learning


# Reinforcement Learning
Environment -> Action -> Reward/Penalty

# Batch Learning
Use alot of data, launched without any learning.

# Online Learning
Opposite of Batch learning, system learns incrementally , providing the system available data as instances, system learns on the fly, speed can be known by the "learning rate"

# Instance based Learning
Simplest , does what the user did

# Model-based Learning
Learns from examples, makes predictions

# Bad , Insufficient Quantity of Training Data
Machine-learning systems require a lot of data to work effectively.

# Poor-Quality Data
Data set with errors and outliers -> Difficulty for the system to detect patterns

# Irrelevant Features
Relevant Data -> Machine Learning System Learns
Irrelevant Data -> Machine Learning System does not learn
not enough features in data -> Machine Learning System does not learn 
you get the point.

# Feature Engineering
